# What is 'ixi' ?
**Shortly: A PixiJS without the P**(ain of using it for game-development)\
__Alternatively__: A small, simple and easy-to-use game-engine* for web development, powered mostly by great pixi.js library!

*should it be called a library?

## A goal 
Is to create simple GameObject-Component oriented system for quick (and lightweight!) development of 2D games (however, my own usage of this library* mostly would be limited to 2D mobile games!)

*should it be called an engine?

## What was done and what will be done:
Well.. The repo is ready, i guess. Anything more is going to take time. \
For the time being, i'll be ready to call project *done* when the next list of features would be implemented:

[ ] 1. The ability to move, rotate and interact with Objects on the screen with only **ixi** tools. \
I know, Pixi is already pretty simplistic and easy-to-learn, but it lacks the often needed tools for game-dev. It's not the downside of Pixi, because, as it is stated on their site: PIXI IS NOT A GAME ENGINE \
And, i hope, IXI will be!

[ ] 2. The support for basic vector graphics & for raster one \
For my convinience, Pixi did a great job at it, so i just need to integrate it into GameDev-specific envelope.

[ ] 3. Colliders  \
I guess, the main reason, why this repo is created: \
Colliders are used __A LOT__ in GameDev, so __ixi__ *really should* gift you the life without Pain of understanding math. You're welcome!

[ ] 4. Graphical enviroment for the development (browser one? who knows!) \
The last step of becoming the full-fledged tool for Game Development. And, i suppose, the hardest one!
